#Question 1 - boot.S vs mpentry.S
`MPBOOTPHYS()` serves to __compute__ the addresses of the values on which `mpentry.S` depends
instead of relying upon the linker to fill in the blanks at compile time. This is called for
because `mpentry.S` is not loaded the same way that `boot.S` is. `boot.S` is loaded by 
the BIOS into memory above the BIOS defined flags (page 0) or about physical address 0x1000.
`MPENTRY_PADDR`, the base address above which the application processors' code is loaded and
their PCs initialized is physical address 0x7000 however the compiler is not aware of this
difference. Were the compiler-generated linking to be used directly, then terrible things
would happen as the application processors would be looking for their values in entirely
the wrong place. Hence the `MPBOOTPHYS()` macro which performs the required address conversion.
